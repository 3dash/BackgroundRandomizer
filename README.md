# BackgroundRandomizer v2.0
BackgroundRandomizer changes the background of your X-Plane menu every time you reload your simulator. Version 2.0 is a rewrite to make the plugin completely independant of FlyWithLua.

## Requirements
- X-Plane 11
- Windows ~~or Linux~~

## How to revert back to the default background image
Run the installer as if you were updating X-Plane, and overwrite all files it says were modified. Keep in mind that this will effect other addons as well.
