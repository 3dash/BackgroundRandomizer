# BackgroundRandomizer
BackgroundRandomizer changes the background of your X-Plane menu every time you open your simulator. When starting your simulator, the background that is using is decided by the last startup. **As a result, no changes to your background may occur when first starting the plugin.**

## Requirements
- X-Plane 11
- Windows or Linux

## How to revert back to the default background image
Run the installer as if you were updating X-Plane, and overwrite all files it says were modified. Keep in mind that this will effect other addons as well. Alternatively, you can only choose to overwrite `image_background_screenshot_for_stack.png`.
