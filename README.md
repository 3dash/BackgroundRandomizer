# XP-RandomBackground
Provides a random background image at startup for X-Plane 11.

# DISCLAIMER: This is unfinished and may be broken.

## Requirements
- Requires the latest Python 3 version, developed for Python 3.7.3

## How to install
- On the releases page, under 'Assets', download the "Install Me" file.
- From the "Install Me" file, move the "randomBackground" folder to the X-Plane root folder.
- Adjust your X-Plane shortcut on your desktop to point to "randomBackground\run.pyw" file.
- Add any files you want to be a background into the "randomBackground\Screenshots" folder. By default, two 1080p photos will be included.

## How to revert back to the default background image
Run the installer as if you were updating X-Plane, and overwrite all files it says were modified. This may effect other addons, such as Airport Enviroment HD. If it does effect other addons, just reinstall them.
