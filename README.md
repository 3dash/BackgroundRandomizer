# BackgroundRandomizer
*originally XP-BackgroundRandomizer*

BackgroundRandomizer changes the background of your X-Plane menu every time you reload your simulator. 
**NOTE: as of the current version, you may not see a custom background on first start.**

## Requirements
- FlyWithLua
- X-Plane 11
- A working PowerShell (Windows Only)

## How to install
- Drop both XRBG.lua & the XRBG file into FlyWithLua
- **If you are not using Windows, replace XRBG.lua with XRBG_other.lua**
- Drop your screenshots into the XRBG folder

## How to revert back to the default background image
Run the installer as if you were updating X-Plane, and overwrite all files it says were modified. Keep in mind that this will effect other addons as well.
